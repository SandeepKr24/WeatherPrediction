# WeatherPrediction

I do not own the dataset. I have found for it on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiteshsoneji/historical-weather-data-for-indian-cities?select=delhi.csv). 

The model is saved as an h5 file, and can be readily used to predict new data. So, you do not need to run this entire notebook, however if you do wish to run this notebook, then you should keep your Kaggle API username and password handy, as you will be prompted to enter it to download the data.

All the work done is authentic and any similarity found is completely coincidental. If you do find any works which have similar/same content (code, etc) please reach out to me on: 'sksopcs2002@gmail.com'.

Thank you for visiting and have a good day.
