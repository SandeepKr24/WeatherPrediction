# WeatherPrediction

I do not own the dataset. I have found it on Kaggle (link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hiteshsoneji/historical-weather-data-for-indian-cities?select=delhi.csv). 

You do not need to run this entire notebook, however, if you do wish to run this notebook, then you should keep your Kaggle API username and password handy, as you will be prompted to enter it to download the data.

The model has been saved as a pickle file. GitHub does not allow to upload files greater than 25 MB, so you will have to download the model directly using this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f8Zq6KR6W24B-dTt-VUCo26kyAEUIIDB/view?usp=sharing.

All the work done is authentic and any similarity found is completely coincidental. If you do find any works which have similar/same content (code, etc) please reach out to me at: 'sksopcs2002@gmail.com'.

Thank you for visiting and have a good day.
